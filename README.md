## Overview
This repository contains implementations and explanations of various machine learning classification techniques. Classification is a fundamental task in supervised learning where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes. The repository includes different models, performance evaluations, and best practices.

## Classification Algorithms Covered
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- **Na√Øve Bayes**

## Dataset
The repository includes example datasets used for classification tasks, such as:
- Iris dataset


## Performance Evaluation
Each classification technique is evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues and pull requests to enhance the repository.
